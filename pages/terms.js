  Terms & Conditions

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
  <h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> I. AREA OF APPLICATION </h4>
All deliveries provided by Shofrica e.K. (hereinafter referred to as the seller) are performed exclusively on the basis of these general terms and condition of sale and delivery. Any alternative terms and conditions on the part of the customer shall not apply unless we should confirm these in writing. There are no supplementary agreements.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> II. CONCLUSION OF CONTRACT. </h4>

1. The presentation of products in the online shop does not constitute a legally binding offer for the conclusion of a purchase agreement.
2. In ordering the desired goods, via internet, e-mail or by telephone the customer makes a legally binding offer to conclude a purchase agreement. The purchase agreement is entered into once this offer has been accepted by the seller.

  The customer can select products from the assortment of the supplier and collect them via the button "shopping cart" in a so-called shopping cart. By clicking on the "Checkout" button and after entering the personal data as well as the terms of payment and shipping, the order process is completed by clicking on the "complete order" button and is binding and binding. Before sending the order, the customer can change and view the data at any time.

  The provider then sends the customer an automatic confirmation of receipt by e-mail, in which the customer's order is listed again and the customer can print out the function "Print". The automatic acknowledgment of receipt merely documents that the customer's order has been received by the supplier and does not constitute acceptance of the request. The supplier can accept the order by sending an order confirmation by e-mail or by delivering the goods within three days.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> III. PRICES </h4>

Our prices are in Euros and do NOT include the currently applicable statutory VAT and exclude postage.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> IV. RETENTION OF TITLE </h4>

The purchase item shall remain the property of the seller until paid for in full.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> V. WARRANTY </h4>

For the goods offered by the provider, the general statutory warranty rights apply. Compared with entrepreneurs, the warranty obligation for goods delivered by the supplier is 12 months.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> VI. DATA PROTECTION </h4>


Our <a href="/privacy" className="cjs-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a> applies.

<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4"> VII. RIGHT OF REVOCATION </h4>
