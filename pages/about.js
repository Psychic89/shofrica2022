              </h2>
              <h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
  Shofrica is founded on the idea that beauty should complement and empower the dynamic life you lead.

  When we envisioned what we wanted Shofrica to be, we asked ourselves - what would the most amazing luxury jewelry brand look like in ten years? We concluded that the future of jewelry would be handmade, perform at the highest luxury level, welcome everyone who loves jewelry, help people fuel their lives inside and out, be sustainable, transparent, digital-first and cruelty-free. This is the vision behind Shofrica. We are a work in progress and a brand in motion.

  Developed through a unique perspective, these are the products we felt were missing from your jewelry box — standout pieces that transcend seasons for the modern individual who lives life on-the-move and to the fullest.

  OUR DESIGNS
            </h3>
            <h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
              Whether statements or staples, all our designs begins as pencil. We start by sketching the details of everyday, giving each piece the same originality and individuality of our women. Drawing from many muses across Frankfurt — rings modeled after the arches of the Eiserner Steg, earrings inspired by padlocks, and the never-ending movement of the city — We take design inspiration from real, everyday life and sets the stage for adding a little shine.

  OUR QUALITY
</h3>
            <h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
  Each of our pieces is designed and handmade using ethically sourced and sustainably made brass and 18K gold-plated vermeil. We maintain a rigorous process to ensure that each piece lasts a lifetime.

  So we go the extra mile, coating our vermeil in 18K gold (instead of the industry standard of 10K gold) and finish with a protective layer of top coat.

  We also look a little closer by meticulously sourcing our gemstones, handpicking, and lab-testing them to ensure ideal cut, color, and quality clarity.

  Last but not least, our seventh generation craftsmen work a little harder here while we oversee every step of the process.

  We design in Frankfurt and work with independent craftsmen in Kenya who lias directly to our team and global network. By adapting to digital transformation, we challenge traditional manufacturing models by combining traditional craft methods with 3D Printing for commercial production. Our microfactories are small to medium-scale manufacturing setups posessing a wide range of processes.

  OUR ETHICS
</h3>
<h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
  We only use materials that keep our consciences clear. There are a lot of ugly practices in jewelry and we're out to change that.

So we began by only using 100% recycled brass. Recycled brass is an amazing resource, a great alternative to gold able to be reused without creating any environmental decay.

  Going a step further we decided to take the same approach with our gemstones. We track every single one from mine to workshop, additionally insisting that our mines offer fair pay and respect local indigenous communities.

  Jewelry with strong ethics—for all your antics.
